==========================================================================
*programslice-slicing*

Slicing~

Use the ex command to slice the current line in a buffer with Python
code:
>
    :SliceBuffer
<
in a vim session. Depending lines will be marked if the slicing is
successful. If the slicing returns no result, nothing will be highlighted.

You can also toggle the slicing with:
>
    :ToggleSliceBuffer
<

*programslice-configuration*

Configuration~

Marker Color

You can overwrite the highlight group depending lines are marked:
>
    let g:programslice_dependent_lines = 'WarningMsg'
<
A list of possible groups to link against can be obtained in a vim
session by:
>
    :highlight
<

*programslice-cmd*
Path to the Command Line Utility

You may need to set the path to the command line utility manually if
``programslice`` is not installed in your ``$PATH``. For example, in
your ``vim.rc`` add
>
    let g:programslice_cmd = "/home/user/programslice/bin/programslice"
<

programslice-debugfile
Use a log for debugging

You may set a file to debug how the command line utility is invoked:


    let g:programslice_debug_file = "/tmp/programslice.debug"


programslice-version
Disable version check

You may disable the version check by setting:

    let g:programslice_disable_version_check = 1

Toggle Slicing

You can bind the slicing to a function key if you want::
>
    autocmd FileType python map <F9> :ToggleSliceBuffer<CR>
